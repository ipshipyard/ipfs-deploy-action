# Deploy to IPFS Action

This GitHub Action automates the deployment of static sites to IPFS using [CAR files](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#car). It pins to either Kubo, IPFS Cluster, or [Storacha](https://storacha.network), as well as supporting additional pinning to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud). The action will automatically create a preview link and update your PR/commit status with the deployment information.

This action is built and maintained by [Interplanetary Shipyard](http://ipshipyard.com/).

The [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#composite-actions) makes no assumptions about your build process. You should just run your build and then call this action (as a step in an existing job) with the `path-to-deploy` input set to the path of your build output directory.

## How does this compare to the other IPFS actions?

This action encapsulates the established best practices for deploying static sites to IPFS in 2025

- Merkleizes the build into a CAR file in GitHub Actions using `ipfs-car`. This ensures that the CID is generated in the build process and is the same across multiple providers.
- Uploads the CAR file to IPFS via [Storacha](https://storacha.network).
- Optionally pins the CID of the CAR file to Pinata. This is useful for redundancy (multiple providers). The pinning here is done in the background and non-blocking. (When pinning, Pinata will fetch the data from Storacha.)
- Updates the PR/commit status with the deployment information and preview links.

## Storacha configuration

To set up the Storacha, you will need to install [w3cli](https://github.com/storacha/w3cli) and login with your Storacha account.

Once logged in:

- [Create a new space](https://docs.storacha.network/how-to/ci/#create-a-space) (like an S3 bucket) to which you will upload the merkleized CAR files.
- [Create a signing key](https://docs.storacha.network/how-to/ci/#create-a-signing-key) that will be used in CI to sign requests to Storacha.
- [Create a UCAN proof](https://docs.storacha.network/how-to/ci/#create-a-proof) that will be used in CI to sign requests to Storacha.

The signing key and proof will be used as [inputs](#inputs) to the action.

## Usage

### Simple Workflow (No Fork PRs)

For repositories that don't accept PRs from forks, you can use a single workflow:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to IPFS

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      cid: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.cid }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to IPFS
        uses: ipfs/ipfs-deploy-action@v1
        id: deploy
        with:
          path-to-deploy: out
          storacha-key: ${{ secrets.STORACHA_KEY }}
          storacha-proof: ${{ secrets.STORACHA_PROOF }}
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
```

### Dual Workflows (With Fork PRs)

For secure deployments of PRs from forks, use two separate workflows that pass artifacts between them:

**`.github/workflows/build.yml`** - Builds without secrets access:
```yaml
name: Build

permissions:
  contents: read

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  BUILD_PATH: 'out'  # Update this to your build output directory

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}


      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: website-build-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}
          retention-days: 1
```

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Deploys with secrets access:
```yaml
name: Deploy

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [completed]

env:
  BUILD_PATH: 'website-build'  # Directory where artifact from build.yml will be unpacked

jobs:
  deploy-ipfs:
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      cid: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.cid }}
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: website-build-${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          path: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}
          run-id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}

      - name: Deploy to IPFS
        uses: ipfs/ipfs-deploy-action@v1
        id: deploy
        with:
          path-to-deploy: ${{ env.BUILD_PATH }}
          storacha-key: ${{ secrets.STORACHA_KEY }}
          storacha-proof: ${{ secrets.STORACHA_PROOF }}
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
```

See real-world examples:
- [IPFS Specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/.github/workflows) - Uses the secure two-workflow pattern
- [IPFS Docs](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/tree/main/.github/workflows) - Uses the secure two-workflow pattern

## FAQ

- How can I safely build on PRs from forks?
  - Use the two-workflow pattern shown above. The build workflow runs on untrusted fork code without secrets access, while the deploy workflow only runs after a successful build and has access to secrets but never executes untrusted code. This pattern uses GitHub's `workflow_run` event to securely pass artifacts between workflows.
- What's the difference between uploading a CAR and using the Pinning API?
  - Since the CAR is like a tarball of the full build with some additional metadata (merkle proofs), the upload will be as big as the build output. Pinning with the [Pinning API](https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec) in contrast is just a request to instruct the pinning service to retrieve and pin the data. At the time this action is first released, CAR uploads is supported by Kubo, Storacha, and Filebase, but not Pinata.
- How can I update DNSLink?
  - See https://github.com/ipfs/dnslink-action as a complement to this action.
